> Currently, the entire country has created an atmosphere of awareness to fight the corona virus crisis. The government is appealing to everyone not to make haste and maintain social distance and stay at home. People are staying in their homes during the lockdown situation, but still have to move out of the house to get groceries,vegetables and essential medicines,etc. While doing so is not more appropriate. So I created this app for home delivery of groceries and dairies and medicines goods.
